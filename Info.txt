A simple project to simulate searching through and editing properties saved in a database table.
Business Requirements: Form that searches and edits properties in a database.
Main purpose: Retain learned knowledge about spring, spring boot, maven, oracle DB, SQL, AngularJS, RESTFul web service, 
data persistence, OWASP Stinger security, liquibase and other technologies. 

Steps:
0- Connect to GitHub.                                                   done
1- Maven and the pom file.                                              done
2- Set up DB and connect to it.                                         done
3- Setup liquibase and YAML files.                                      done
4- Create DB table(s)                                                   done
5- Set up RESTFul API with MVC and strategy pattern in mind.             -
6- Set up DAO and connect to DB with persistence.                       done
7- Create front end with AngularJS and MVC in mind.                     done
8- Add security and OWASP Stinger.                                      -
9- Pagination in results pages.                                         -
10- Note how Spring boot is used. Review and Answer questions.          -
11- Host using tomcat                                                   done
12- Create unit Tests using mockito and run them.                       -
13- Smoke test.                                                         done
14- Use sql inserts statements from yaml file.                          -


Project: properties-search-edit-form:
- Spring Boot back end
- Uses SQL backend. Oracle.
- Uses MAVEN config. liquibase, YAML files, DAOs, Hibernate (for schema) and SQL files to initialize
database with schema and data.
- Uses YAML files for spring configuration.
- Strategy pattern to search type of property.
- Uses MVC in Java Spring and in AngularJS
- AngularJS front end to search for key/value pairs.
- AngularJS to update without refresh, use derivatives, 3 types of properties.
- OWASP Stinger with rulesets and regex to secure field inputs
- Pagination


Should be able to answer these questions:
- What defines a RESTful web service and how is it different than SOAP.
- How did you set up the backend for this service?
- How did you connect the Angular front end to the restful web service?
- What is a directive in AngularJS? and How is it used?
- How did you use Angular controllers in this project?
- What is Java Spring and what is Java Spring Boot and how are they different than say Struts 2?
- What is MVC and did you use it? If so â€¦ how?
- What persistence framework did you use? Hibernate? and how did you use it?
- What is a POJO and how have you used it?
- What is strategy pattern and how did you use it to solve a design problem?
- What is OWASP Stinger? and how did you use it in Java Spring to secure the application?
- How did you implement key/value tags filtering in AngularJS? What parts where in the front end and what parts
were in the back end and why?
- How did you use CRUD SQL queries to initialize the database?
- What is a DAO? and how did you use it in your project?
- What is separation of concerns?
- Mention one other design patterns other than strategy pattern and explain what it is and how you used it, if at all?
- Mention one other programming principle other than separation of concerns and explain what it is and perhaps
how you used it, if at all?
- What is liquibase?
- What is maven?
I used Maven mainly as a build tool to help with building multiple jars and manage dependencies and versions. It also
helps with setting up the project structure, building, publishing and deployment.
- What is pagination and how did you use it in a project?
- What is hibernate and JPA and how are they different and how did you use any of them, if at all, in a project?
- What are microservices and how are they different than RestFul services?
